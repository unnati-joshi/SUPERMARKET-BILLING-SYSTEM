# 🛒 Supermarket Billing System (C++ Console Application)

## ❗ Statement of the Problem

Manual and semi-digital billing systems result in:

- Frequent human errors in bill calculations
- No real-time inventory deductions
- Difficulty accessing customer purchase history
- Inability to generate quick and accurate sales reports
- Lack of integration between billing, inventory, and customer data

These limitations affect customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, especially during peak hours. There's a strong need for an accurate, fast, and automated billing system.
