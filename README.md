# Supermarket Billing System (C++ Console Application)

##  Statement of the Problem

Manual and semi-digital billing systems result in:

- Frequent human errors in bill calculations
- No real-time inventory deductions
- Difficulty accessing customer purchase history
- Inability to generate quick and accurate sales reports
- Lack of integration between billing, inventory, and customer data

These limitations affect customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, especially during peak hours. There's a strong need for an accurate, fast, and automated billing system.

-  Automatically generates bills, applies discounts, and prints receipts
-  Manages inventory in real-time — updates stock upon purchases and restocking
-  Stores and retrieves customer data for tracking purchase history
-  Produces basic session-based sales reports (total revenue, number of transactions)
-  Ensures persistent data storage using file handling
-  Offers a simple, menu-driven interface usable with minimal training
